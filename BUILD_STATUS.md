### Expected Timeline:

- **Upload Time**: 1-2 minutes  
- **Download Size**: ~50-80 MB for development build

## 📱 What to Do When Build Completes

### 1. Download the APK
- You'll receive a download link when build completes
- Or visit the Expo dashboard to download
- File will be named something like: `application-[hash].apk`

### 2. Install on Android Device
```bash
# Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" on your Android device:
# Settings > Security > Unknown Sources (or App Install permissions)

# Install via USB debugging (if enabled):
adb install path/to/your/app.apk

# Or directly download and install on device
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
# Instead of: npx expo start
# Use this for development builds:
npx expo start --dev-client

# Alternative with tunnel (if network issues):
npx expo start --dev-client --tunnel
```

## 🔧 Development Build Features

### What You'll Get:
✅ **Native Performance**: Much faster than Expo Go  
✅ **Push Notifications**: Work properly on physical devices  
✅ **Full Native Access**: All native dependencies work  
✅ **Custom Native Code**: Can add any native modules  
✅ **Production-like**: Behavior closer to final app  

### Your Notification System Benefits:
✅ **Real Push Tokens**: Actual Expo push tokens generated  
✅ **Proper Permissions**: Native permission dialogs  
✅ **Background Notifications**: Work when app is closed  
✅ **Notification Channels**: Android notification channels work  
✅ **Deep Linking**: Notification navigation works perfectly  

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Development:
1. **Start Dev Server**: `npx expo start --dev-client`
2. **Open Your Custom App**: (not Expo Go)
3. **Select Development Server**: Choose your local server
4. **Code & Reload**: Hot reload works normally

### When Changes Don't Appear:
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --dev-client --clear

# Hard reload in app
# Shake device -> "Reload" or Ctrl+R
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Wait for Build** (5-15 minutes)
2. **Download APK** when complete
3. **Install on Android Device**
4. **Test Push Notifications** (they'll work properly now!)
5. **Use `npx expo start --dev-client`** for development

## 📊 Alternative: Use Preview Build

If you want to test immediately, you already have a preview build available:
```
Application Archive URL: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/96sWkwBBAshRjd7xf8xkwV.apk
```

This preview build will also work much better than Expo Go, though it doesn't include development tools.
